# Netflix-Nerd-App

My 2nd personal project. :P

This project was created to learn how to work with:
- URLSession and APIs (later i might try to recreate it with Alamofire!!)
- Combine pipelines
- CoreData
- CoreLocation
- FileManager
- NSCache
- and UI was "copied" from Netflix app

The excuse why this code is not very as clean as i would like to be: :D
- Basically from a small file to learn how to work with some cool APIs on internet it ended up being a much "bigger" project where i tried to do a simple "recreation of Netflix app".
- So i rewriting old code everyday bcs it was not scalable at all and still it is not fine but i moved on to my new project to have a new clean Start.
